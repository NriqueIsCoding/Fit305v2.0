# "Fit 305" Ruby in rails application

This Web application was coded using ruby, javascript, jquery. APIs for the google map, weather and payment processing were used too. The application was design for workout trainers and end users too. An instructor will be able to create a profile, upload a picture and enter an outdoor location such as a park, or a beach where they want to give their classes. A user will create a profile and pick from the classes that were created by the instructor.
